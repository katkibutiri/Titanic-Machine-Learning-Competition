Titanic Machine Learning Competition
Welcome to the legendary Titanic ML competition on Kaggle! This challenge serves as an excellent entry point into the world of machine learning competitions and provides an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the Kaggle platform.

Description
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Tragically, there were not enough lifeboats for all passengers and crew, resulting in the loss of 1502 lives out of 2224.

This competition tasks participants with building a predictive model to answer the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

How Kaggle’s Competitions Work
Join the Competition: Read about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules, and gain access to the competition dataset.

Get to Work: Download the data and build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks, our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs.

Make a Submission: Upload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.

Check the Leaderboard: See how your model ranks against other participants on the Kaggle leaderboard.

Improve Your Score: Explore the discussion forum to find tutorials and insights from other competitors to enhance your model.

Competition Data
In this competition, you'll have access to two similar datasets: train.csv and test.csv.

train.csv: Contains details of a subset of the passengers on board (891) and reveals whether they survived or not, known as the "ground truth".
test.csv: Contains similar information but does not disclose the "ground truth" for each passenger. Your task is to predict these outcomes for the 418 passengers in the test dataset.
Explore the datasets further in the "Data" tab and submit your model to see where it stands on the Kaggle leaderboard.
